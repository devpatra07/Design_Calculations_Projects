ðŸ“Œ Project Title
Design Calculations for CSTR and Bubble Column Reactor
Reaction: COâ‚‚ + DIPA â†’ Products
Kinetics: First-order in COâ‚‚ and second-order in DIPA
Plant Capacity: 80 tons/day (based on total throughput)

ðŸ“„ Description
This folder contains the detailed design calculations for two types of reactors:

Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)

Bubble Column Reactor (BCR)

used for the treatment of carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) with Diisopropylamine (DIPA). The goal is to design these reactors to handle a flow rate equivalent to 80 tons per day of the reacting mixture.
