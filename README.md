# 📘 Reactor Design Calculations: CO₂ + DIPA → Products

## Overview

This repository contains the design calculations for two reactor systems:

- **Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)**
- **Bubble Column Reactor (BCR)**

for the gas-liquid reaction:

The kinetics follow:
- **First-order in CO₂**
- **Second-order in DIPA**

The design is based on a **plant capacity of 80 tons/day** of total feed.
