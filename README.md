# 📘 Reactor Design Calculations: CO₂ + DIPA → Products

## Overview

This repository contains the design calculations for two reactor systems:

- **Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)**
- **Bubble Column Reactor (BCR)**

for the gas-liquid reaction:

The kinetics follow:
- **First-order in CO₂**
- **Second-order in DIPA**

The design is based on a **plant capacity of 80 tons/day** of total feed.

## 🔬 Reaction Kinetics

The rate law used is:

\[
-r_A = k \cdot C_{\text{CO}_2} \cdot C_{\text{DIPA}}^2
\]

Where:  
- \( r_A \): rate of reaction  
- \( k \): reaction rate constant  
- \( C_{\text{CO}_2} \), \( C_{\text{DIPA}} \): concentrations of CO₂ and DIPA respectively
